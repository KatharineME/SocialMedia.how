## Sell

Your face is more powerful than your logo.

Use storytelling in marketing.

Focus on how to help the client instead of trying to sell them something. Empathy wins sales.

People buy the transformation not the product.

People buy with emotion and justify with logic.

Everyone's motivation revolves around two drives: emotional (raising status and feeling loved) and biological (fulfilling basic needs). Think how you can speak to these motivations.

## Productivity

If you don’t invest in yourself because you’re scared of losing money, you’ll never do anything significant in life.

Use mornings for focus and exercise. Use evenings for reflection.

Focus on one task at a time.

Turn on Do Not Disturb.
