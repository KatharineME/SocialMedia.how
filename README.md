## Sell

Your face is more powerful than your logo.

Use storytelling in marketing.

Focus on how to help the client instead of trying to sell them something. Empathy wins sales.

People buy the transformation not the product.

People buy with emotion and justify with logic.

Everyone's motivation revolves around two drives: emotional (raising status and feeling loved) and biological (fulfilling basic needs). Speak to these motivations.

## Build Your Network

Message and connect with people who are on your follower level. Many will grow with you and help you later on.
